🚀 Toshan Bakery — Best Bakery in Naya Raipur😅😅 🍰🥐

Make fun आगे देखो मजा आएगा 😎
I am thrilled to share the complete digital ecosystem I have built for Toshan Bakery — from the customer-facing website to a powerful admin dashboard for management and analytics.

Core Features and Technologies:
✅ Payment Gateway & Refunds:
Integrated Razorpay for secure payments with robust automatic refund handling for canceled orders. Personally tested refunds take about 1.5 days to reflect in customer accounts.

✅ Atomic & Consistent Inventory Management:
Used Firebase runTransaction API to built custom Nodejs server for automatic, server-side inventory decrement ensuring Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) to prevent race conditions and maintain concurrency integrity.

✅ Client + Server-side Validations:
Implemented logic in both frontend (cart & checkout) and backend to verify item quantities and stock before confirming orders, guaranteeing perfect data integrity.

✅ User Experience Enhancements:

Save addresses for quick next orders

Sophisticated sorting algorithms for shop & order pages

Favorites system to track liked items

Dedicated item pages with individual review system shown upon order delivery

Add personal customization notes per item at checkout

Powerful search supporting item names & descriptions

Responsive and mobile-friendly UI — delivers an app-like experience for all users

✅ Custom Email Servers:
Built own mail servers for timely welcome emails and order confirmations, powered by Node.js and deployed on Vercel Free Tier. Due to Render free-tier hosting for order service, initial cold starts may sometimes delay email confirmation.

✅ Automated Stock Restocking:
When orders are canceled, items are automatically restocked via backend processes.

About the Admin Dashboard:
🛠️ An all-in-one management system with:

Seamless order and product management pages

Advanced data analytics displaying key insights such as top-selling items and peak order hours

Automated CSV generation with multiple sorting parameters for custom data exports

🤖 Powered by an end-to-end prediction pipeline:

Automatically fetches raw data from the database

Trains and updates machine learning models without manual intervention

Sends predictions to API and stores them in Firebase for further use

Tech Stack Highlights:
Next.js | Node.js | Firebase (Firestore, Functions)

Nodemailer | Chart.js | Tailwind CSS | Python for prediction models

Advanced use of AI tools including GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Perplexity AI helped accelerate development.

Created 6 separate GitHub accounts to utilize GitHub Copilot for free and implemented secret code protections for my proprietary code.

Why I Built This:
This project was a personal growth challenge and a fun way to explore full-stack and AI-integrated development. Proudly developed end-to-end by me, it's a testament to what one developer can achieve with determination and resourcefulness.

🙏 If you have feedback or suggestions for enhancements, I would love to hear from you!

Thanks for all the support and encouragement. Much love to the community! ❤️
